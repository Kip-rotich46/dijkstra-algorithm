# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, a famous algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, and the program calculates the shortest distance from the source node to each of the other nodes in the graph.

## Introduction

Dijkstra’s algorithm is an efficient way to compute the shortest paths in a graph. The graph used in this program is represented by an adjacency matrix, where each element represents the weight of the edge between two nodes. The algorithm works by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance and updating its neighbors accordingly. It’s especially useful for graphs with non-negative weights.

This program is written in **C** and calculates the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a directed graph.

## How to Run the Code

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine or open it in GitHub Codespaces:

```bash

2. Compile the Code
The code is written in C. To compile it, use the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o dijkstra dijkstra.c
3. Run the Program
After compiling, you can run the program with the following command:

Example Output
The program calculates the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes. Below is an example output:

vbnet
Copy code
Shortest distances from source (0):
Distance from 0 to 0: 0
Distance from 0 to 1: 4
Distance from 0 to 2: 5
Distance from 0 to 3: 2147483647
Distance from 0 to 4: 2147483647
Distance from 0 to 5: 2147483647
Distance from 0 to 6: 2147483647
Distance from 0 to 7: 2147483647
In this example:

The source node is 0.
2147483647 represents nodes that are unreachable from the source.
